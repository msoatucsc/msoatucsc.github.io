	<h1>Benefits of Cardio Exercise in the Morning</h1>
	<p>Hevtee Desai</p>	

	

	<p>Let’s face it. We all know that we should be getting those 60 minutes of exercise daily but aren't able to muster the courage to get out there and work out. Our sleepy morning selves are just not up for it, and later in the day we are overwhelmed with work and too exhausted. However, getting in a cardio workout in the morning can improve productivity and your mood for the day. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Studies report that working out in the morning increases the flow of the hormones called: 
	<a href = "https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-truth-behind-runners-high-and-other-mental-benefits-of-running#:~:text=When%20you%20start%20out%20on,body%20releases%20hormones%20called%20endorphins">endorphins</a> 
	and adrenaline in the body, which trigger a positive euphoria-like feeling. This feeling is also called “runner’s high” which can last for hours past the workout, boosting your productivity and energy throughout the day. With higher energy levels in the morning, it is likely that your focus and attention will be present over the day, helping you succeed in school or complete tasks at work. Often, morning grogginess can influence your focus or mood during the day and this can be combated with the energy boost from exercise in the mornings. The hormone cortisol, whose levels increase in the morning, also helps you get up naturally and in the mood to exercise as opposed to the afternoon or evening when the cortisol hormone levels are lower. This hormone can be used to your advantage in the mornings to wake up and exercise rather than another time of day.
	<br/>
	Working out also improves your mental health. Exercising and working creates a feeling of achievement and self-worth, boosting your mental health and mood for the day. 
	This in turn,  reduces stress & anxiety levels which often come from having excessive work or while studying. Specifically exercising outside in the morning allows you to appreciate the calmness and beauty of nature before the daily rush starts, serving as a mood-booster. Cardio also provides mental and physical stimulation, helping one get through the day, especially as a student.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Lastly, we can not forget the health benefits which include a jump-start to one’s metabolism. After a workout, the next meal is used by the body for energy rather than fat storage. For those who would like to reduce their weight, exercising in the morning, before a meal is the best time to achieve that goal. Research from a Belgian study showed that a 
	<a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20837645/">high-calorie diet had no effect on fasting exercisers</a>, but caused those who exercised post meals to gain weight. This is because exercising before breakfast mimics a state of fasting, so little to no food is actually broken down into fat to store. A 
	<a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844280/">Japanese study</a> also found that fat oxidation which is the breakdown of fatty acids occurs if people work out before breakfast, also helping reduce the amount of food that is converted to fat.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Exercising in the morning has immense benefits to your physical and mental health and the potential to boost daily productivity. The mental health benefits of going outdoors can improve your mood, benefitting you and the people around you. So, tomorrow morning, wake up, and start exercising!</p>
