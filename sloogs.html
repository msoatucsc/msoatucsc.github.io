	      <p style="font-size: 17px; margin-bottom: 7%;">"In high school, I had an extreme case of acne and scars that I was embarrassed of, which lowered my self-esteem and confidence. I started doing research on home remedies that reduced scarring and red spots, but I stumbled upon reading different products that worked best for my skin type, even remembering certain ingredients and what specific amounts were recommended. It was interesting how different topical medications and products are used to regulate certain cells and areas of the body, and that there are many more being researched today. I'm inspired to share my knowledge and experience with those who are dealing with the same thing, to help them explore methods of treatment, listen to their stories, and ultimately develop a personal connection with them while learning more about other medications."</p>

When we were learning about neurons and action potentials, it just amazed me how simple things such as wiggling our fingers, to larger tasks such as weight lifting, were all due to these weird looking things. The brain is such a fascinating organ and there's so much we don't know about it, which is insane! I'm stoked for some brainception to use my brain to learn about my brain and hopefully be able to apply that knowledge to help those who are affected."</p>

Growing up, I was always intrigued by the process of how drugs work in the body. Thus, I really enjoy the human physiology branch of biology because I can learn how different organisms of the body functions and how they work with drugs after ingesting them. By studying biology, I hope to influence my knowledge of science and drugs to help those who are ill and see how the field of science progresses over time."</p>

I just have always knew that I loved science and I wanted to pursue a career in doing something that involve science. That love grew even more when I decided to major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology here at UCSC. I'm glad I chose this major because it really taught me all these chemical and physicochemical processes and substances that occur within living beings and about how much I didn't know about everything. That's why I want to pursue a career in science."</p>

I was never a student who could sit still for a long time so reading and math didn't hold my attention very well. But science, especially for kids, is really hands on and being able to build things and see tiny things through a microscope was enough to excite me. Science is amazing! Everyday someone is discovering something new and one day that person can be you."</p>

	    <p style="font-size: 15.3px">"Growing up, my mom would always share the anecdote of when her petition from the Philippines to the U.S. was approved in the middle of her education as a scholar at the Saint Louis University, which is known for its top-scoring Medical and Law students. She set aside her own aspirations of higher learning for the sake of the future family she would have in America. Keeping in mind the invaluable sacrifices that both my mom and dad have made, I urged myself to approach school with an unrivaled hunger and thirst for knowledge, sampling its many facets with enthusiasm and passion: writing, history, art, politics, math, and science. The subject of biology, however, intrigued me like no other starting from introductory Biology during my freshman year of high school. In college, my professors present what is already known. Then, I apply that knowledge to the work I do in the mammary gland research lab I volunteer at only to find out that what we do know is just barely the tip of the iceberg. Science doesn't sleep. And while the grind never ends, the demands of this very subject matter drives me to learn more each and every day. I want to pursue a career in the field of medical science, my little niche."</p>

	    	<br/>
	    	<br/>
		He was a heroin addict. He stopped providing love and support for his family. Detached, he only showed up to ask for money. He passed away due to heart failure.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		I believe that if given another chance to life, my father would have a change of heart and live differently.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		I want to fight for second chances. I want to fight to improve patients' quality of life. My ultimate goal is to instill hope -- whether that be determination to recover, or the perseverance to live life to the fullest. Life is fragile, yet beautifully complex.

		I want to combine drugs along with knowledge and empathy to heal."</p>

As a psych major, I’ve come to really enjoy everything that I have learned through my time here at UCSC. I've always had an interest in mental health care, especially the stigma behind attending counseling and psychological services. Mental health disorders or whatever people like to label it as, are portrayed in the world as alien making those victims vulnerable to criticism just because of who they are! I want to push forward and desensitize the negative treatment placed on those who aren't considered “normal”. Many believe that psychology majors don’t do much, but I want to ignite my ambitions to serve those being misjudged and bring people to tolerate mental health issues!"</p>

These magical, esoteric phenomenon are made in practical components through science. The advancements in science have allowed us to challenge nearly every notion of life, and it has led a standard of living that would have been impossible to dream of. Science has the ability to empower while still remaining dynamic. From walking on the moon to sequencing the human genome, the bounds of discovery are endless. Thousands of lives have been saved and each day another new revolutionary advancement is discovered. "</p>

The first bio class that I ever took was in my freshman year of high school, so I don't really recall anything but Punnett Squares. But when I took my bio introductory class at UCSC, I was learning a lot and stuff was just fascinating. And I like to learn. Science is cool and I like cool science. So I guess I am pretty cool too.
